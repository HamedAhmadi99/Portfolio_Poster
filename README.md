# Election Integrity and Civic Engagement: A Global Study in 2023

# Overview: 
This study, conducted as part of the class project SIS-750-007: Data Analysis at the School of International Service (SIS), American University, during Spring 2024, explores the relationship between electoral integrity and civic engagement using data from the 2023 Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project. It aims to assess whether countries with higher levels of electoral integrity experience increased citizen participation in governance. The choice of topic is deeply personal, stemming from experiences in Afghanistanâ€”a country characterized by low electoral integrity and citizen participation over the past two decades, now entirely governed by an undemocratic authoritarian regime under Taliban rule. This could potentially pave the way for me to expand this research beyond the confines of this class project

# Data Source:
The study draws upon data from the 2023 Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project, offering comprehensive insights into democratic practices worldwide across approximately 4,000 political entities. For more information, please visit the V-Dem Dataset: https://www.v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/ 

# Approach:
Employing simple linear regression, the research examines the impact of the Clean Elections Index (CEI) on the Participatory Democracy Index (PDI). The hypothesis posits a positive correlation, suggesting that higher electoral integrity fosters greater civic engagement. However, the study acknowledges limitations due to uncontrolled variables such as economic conditions, cultural norms, and political stability, which may influence the results. Future research should aim to incorporate these variables and explore different statistical methods to better understand the complexities of democratic engagement.
